                            Problem Statement :

Create a FullStack project,in order to achieve the following details shared with you below :

●	Create a user friendly UI for displaying a course card based on the data fetched from backend 
●	The given course card will be topic wise and we must have a search functionality to search for a particular course.
●	After the user clicks on a particular course, he/she will be redirected to that particular course where we will have multiple cards to select , one for assignment based on that topic,another the subtopics list for that particular course.

Sample outlook : HTML (course):-
                1.HTML display     (subtopics)  
                2. HTML Positions

●	We will also have reading material tabs for subtopics of that particular topic/course.
●	We will have an assignment tab containing all the assignments related to a particular course with subtopics marked with it.
●	It should have a login and registration feature with all the authentication features.



BACKEND :
	

●	You will be provided a CSV/Excel file containing details regarding assignment details and course card details .
●	You can use any external node module to read and parse the data from this CSV/excel file.
●	Create a database model and Schema based on the data parsed and map it to their own database model.

●	Create your own custom Api for handling login and registration and authenticate the user.
●	Create custom API for providing the course card data to client/UI/frontend and also create API for providing assignment data as well to frontend.
●	Use the business logic which fits later , if an admin adds some new course data in CSV or some new assignment in the same CSV file , it should be parsed automatically and added to your database and accordingly update the UI.
